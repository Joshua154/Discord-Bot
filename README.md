It includes methods for creating buttons with or without emojis, and an onClick function that handles adding or removing roles based on user interaction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| [bodypart.js](https://github.com/Joshua154/Discord-Bot/blob/master/commands/dnd/bodypart.js)                       | This code snippet is a Discord.js slash command that rolls a dice to determine a body part. It takes optional parameters for the number of times to roll the dice and the user to roll for. It also has an option to roll the dice privately. The execution of the command sends an embed with the result.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| [characterSheet.js](https://github.com/Joshua154/Discord-Bot/blob/master/commands/dnd/characterSheet.js)           | This code snippet defines a Discord slash command called "character_sheet" with two subcommands: "save" and "load". The "save" subcommand allows users to save a character sheet by providing a campaign name and an attached file. The file is downloaded from the provided URL and saved in a specified directory. The "load" subcommand retrieves and displays the character sheets of a specified campaign by reading the PDF files from the campaign's directory and sending them as attachments in a Discord embed message.                            |
| [countOfRolles.js](https://github.com/Joshua154/Discord-Bot/blob/master/commands/dnd/countOfRolles.js)             | This code snippet is an implementation of a Discord slash command. It retrieves the number of a specific roll from a MySQL database based on user input. The code uses the discord.js library for interacting with the Discord API and the mysql library for connecting to the database. It handles optional user and number options, performs the database query, calculates the count of each roll, and generates a response embed with the results.                                                                                                       |
| [currency.js](https://github.com/Joshua154/Discord-Bot/blob/master/commands/dnd/currency.js)                       | This code snippet defines a Discord slash command called "currency" that converts a given amount of currency into gold, silver, and pence. It takes the currency amount as input and splits it into gold, silver, and pence values. It then calculates the total pence, converts it into the respective gold, silver, and pence values, and displays them in an embed message. There is a commented-out section for performing calculations between two different currency inputs. The code also includes a helper function for basic arithmetic operations. |
| [currentPlayer.js](https://github.com/Joshua154/Discord-Bot/blob/master/commands/dnd/currentPlayer.js)             | This code snippet defines a Discord slash command called "current_player" that selects a channel as an optional parameter. It retrieves the selected channel or defaults to the member's channel. It then loops through the members of the channel and logs each member.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

It allows users to add or remove substitute people. The command parameters include the substitute and replacing person. The code handles the command execution, updates the substitutes data, and writes it to a JSON file. It also sends appropriate response messages based on the executed subcommand.                                                                                                                                                                        |

When executed, it checks if there is an active music queue. If there is, it sends an embed message with buttons for controlling the music loop mode. The buttons allow the user to set the loop mode to queue, now playing, or turn off looping. The function also handles button interactions and updates the messages accordingly. If an error occurs, it logs the error and sends an error message to the user.                                 |
| [lyrics.js](https://github.com/Joshua154/Discord-Bot/blob/master/commands/music/lyrics.js)                         | This code snippet contains a Discord bot command to display lyrics for a specific song or the current song being played. It uses the discord.js library for interacting with Discord, the axios library for making HTTP requests, and @discordjs/builders for building slash commands. The code fetches lyrics from an API, formats the response into embeds, and sends them as a reply to the user. If no lyrics are found, it sends a message indicating that no lyrics could be found.                                                                    |

It also includes a function to process user votes in a poll.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| [en.js](https://github.com/Joshua154/Discord-Bot/blob/master/languages/en.js)                                      | The code snippet defines a language object that contains various messages used in a bot application. These messages cover different scenarios such as loading events and commands, displaying errors, success messages, information about music, playlists, volumes, and command usage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| [role-message-schema.js](https://github.com/Joshua154/Discord-Bot/blob/master/models/role-message-schema.js)       | This code snippet defines a Mongoose schema for managing button roles in a Guild. It requires three string properties: _id (Guild ID), channelId, and messageId. It exports a Mongoose model using the name'button-roles', creating a new model or using an existing one if available.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

It takes in parameters like data (URL), height, width, and color. If no data is provided, an error is thrown. The function returns a string with the Google API URL and additional query parameters for the specified height, width, color, and background color.                                                                                                                                                                                 |

It allows adding and removing elements from the Multiset, while keeping track of the count of each element. The Multiset can also be sorted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
